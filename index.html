<p>I ventured to create a game about a bored kid whose father is a magician. The kid finds his fathers spell book and accidentally turns himself into a dog. So he is forced to go out and try to find his father to ask him for help. He takes along the spell book and decides to try other spells at random to see if he can find the one that turns him back into a boy. However those spells turn him in to yet other creatures. <br/><br/>

On his journey he is forced to go down dangerous paths and uses his shape-shifting to his advantage turning into whichever form he can to stay alive. </p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About the code</h3>

<p>The code is small and has a lot of potential. It has integration with Java 8 Nashorn so you can expand on the Updaters and input handlers in JavaScript you can experiment with that in <code>resources/init.js</code>. There is a bunch of cleanup left to do to and additional features to make the scripting easier and more capable. Also need to add a gui system was not able to get to one during the competition.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>So give it a try and see what you can make.</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
